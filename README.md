## Installation

This package requires Composer 2.0 or higher.

Require this package as normal dependency:

```bash
composer require gilbertsoft/typo3-core-patches
```

If the package is installed as dev requirement, the patches won't get applied
using the install option `--no-dev`.

For Composer 2.2 and later, plug-ins must be explicitly allowed using the
following command:

```bash
composer config allow-plugins.gilbertsoft/typo3-core-patches true
```

`cweagans/composer-patches` is automatically added by this plugin.

## Usage

### Adding a change

Lookup the change ID at <https://forge.typo3.org> or <https://review.typo3.org>
and provide it as argument or multiple arguments for multiple changes at once:

```bash
composer typo3:patch:apply 12345
composer typo3:patch:apply 12345 23456 34567
```

This plugin will then properly create patch files for the change and save it to
the patch directory which defaults to `patches`. The patch directory can be
changed by the option `--patch-dir` or with the shortcut `-p`:

```bash
composer typo3:patch:apply --patch-dir:path/to/folder 12345
composer typo3:patch:apply -ppath/to/folder 12345
```

By default changes in tests are exluded. If you also like to include these
changes, provide the option `--tests` or the shortcut `-t`. This will result in
installing the sources instead of the dist packages for the affected packages.

```bash
composer typo3:patch:apply --tests 12345
composer typo3:patch:apply -t 12345
```

### Updating a change

To update the applied patches to the last patch sets from Gerrit just run the
following command, which will update all patches:

```bash
composer typo3:patch:update
```

It is also possible to just update some single patches by providing the change
ID as argument or multiple arguments for multiple changes to update at once:

```bash
composer typo3:patch:update 12345
composer typo3:patch:update 12345 23456 34567
```

### Removing a change

Provide the change ID to remove as argument or multiple arguments for multiple
changes to remove at once:

```bash
composer typo3:patch:remove 12345
composer typo3:patch:remove 12345 23456 34567
```

### Supported change ID formats

This plugin supports various change-id formats, as described in
<https://review.typo3.org/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#change-id>.

Additionally, you can also specify the full URL for the change, as shown in the
next example:

```bash
composer typo3:patch:apply https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/12345
```

## Detection of merged changes on update or install

When running `composer update` or `composer install`, the plugin detects changes
that already exist in the version being installed and suggests removing them. If
you run Composer with the `--no-interaction` option, the patches are always
removed.

Errors may occur if you use the source-dist of packages, which can be solved by
adding the `config.discard-changes` configuration option to your `composer.json`,
see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#discard-changes>. Run e.g.
`composer config discard-changes true` to add the configuration to your
`composer.json`.
